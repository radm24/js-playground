          Thousands of pirates were active from 1650â€“1720. These years are
          sometimes known as a 'Golden Age' of piracy. Famous pirates from this
          period include Blackbeard (Edward Teach), Henry Morgan, William
          'Captain' Kidd, 'Calico' Jack Rackham and Bartholomew Roberts.

          During this time news of piracy reached the ears of both rich and
          poor. Ballads about topical events were sung on the streets.
          Newspapers could be freely read in coffee houses for the price of a
          dish of coffee. There was a spectrum of opinion about the exploits of
          the more notorious pirates. Published images often showed them as
          powerful and well dressed.
